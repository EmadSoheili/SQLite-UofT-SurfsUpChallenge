# SQLite, SQLAlchemy and Flask - Surf's Up with Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval

***University of Toronto - Data Analytics Boot Camp - Module 9 - Surf's Up with Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval***

---

## Overview of Project

The analysis purpose is extracting data for a specific month. In first part, we want June's data and in second part, we want December's data.
This will be helpful if stakeholders wanted to compare weather conditions in two different time windows to make data-driven decisions.

## Results

The outputs includes:
  * Temperatures for June
  * Statistics for June
  * Temperatures for December
  * Temperature for December

### Key differences between June and December temperatures

* **Mean** Temperature
    * June: **75°F**
    * December: **71°F**
* **Maximum** Temperature
    * June: **85°F**
    * December: **83°F**
* **Minimum** Temperature
    * June: **64°F**
    * December: **56°F**

## Conclusion

* On average, weather temperature in June is nearly 75°F, and temperature in December is 71°F. <br/>
  There is a 4°F difference in temperature. <br/>
  the Standard Deviation is between 3 and 4°F in both months.
    * *It seems that the temperature difference is not that great that affect the Surfing indursty.*
* Maximum temperature is not very different in June and December (85°F vs. 83°F).
    * *It seems there is not much difference in Surfing experience in the warmest day of June and warmest day of December*
* Minimum temperature shows a eight-degree difference in temperature.
    * *It seems for planning a Surfing trip in December, more precautions should be taken into consideration.*
* Precipitation is nearly 50% higher in December compared to June, both in mean and maximum
    * *It seems December Surfing plan has more precipitation odds, which might affect people's Surfing experience*
